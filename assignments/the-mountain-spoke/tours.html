                        <p>Come hill climb the old Iron Goat Trail! This is for more experienced riders that are looking for a workout. Because of the trail being used for daily workout routines, we offer a discount to our Gold card members. The trail follows an abandoned mine rail way before heading into the hills. the cost is $30 for adults and $15 for children brave enough to ride it. This trail starts at our main location and starts out with a long short trail to get the muscles warmed up. Then the path starts on steady inclined switch backs. </p>

                        <p>Come join us for a ride on the Centennial Trail! Ride groups go daily on the trail. The biggest group goes during our Spring fling in April. There is also a significant group list set for Fall. Sign up while you still can! The trail goes a total of 30-miles (48 km). However, there are Parking lots about every 3miles off the trail. You can decide how far you would like to go. The paths are paved and are wheel chair accessible. The skill level is low. We often have children on the trail. The cost is $25 for children and $45 for adults. You can join up at any of the parking lots along the trail, or you can come to Mountain Spoke 10mins before starting of your group, and we can shuttle you to our starting point for the group.</p>
